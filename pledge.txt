On my honor:

    I have not discussed the  code in my program with anyone other than my instructor, teammate  or the teaching assistants assigned to this course.
    I have not used Java language code obtained from another student, the Internet, or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
    If any Java language code or documentation used in my program was obtained from an authorized source, such as a textbook or course notes, that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in the comments of my program.
    I have not designed this program in such a way as to defeat or interfere with the normal testing of the code.
