## Instructions on running rlogin

- For running via command line refer [cmd.md](./cmd.md)


Note: 
Java version on rlogin server is 11. This project needs to be compiled with java 8 per instructions in syllabus and elsewhere communicated. Thus, we do not advise compiling and running on rlogin server. The project should be compiled with system having java <9 and then the jar then needs to be copied and run per ( command line) instructions below.  

The programming assignments can either be run via netbeans ide or command line. please follow the respective instructions.md file in github repository 

We have migrated Test files to src/mutex package in order to remove dependencies on junit and make it more convenient to run via command line.
